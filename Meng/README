PDP-8 Memory Simulation Code
Author: Meng Lei

Functions achieved:
1. Allocate page table with desired number of pages and capacity of page
2. Add entry, delete entry, retrieve entry
3. Breakdown 12-bit address
4. Quick probe to see if an address is taken
5. Changed LLL to 2d array of ptrs
6. prompt user when deleting and overwriting
7. Display a memory entry

Things to work on:
1. Consider extremely large page table (using long instead of int)
2. Main test function
3. What if any of the arguments passed into main are gibberish?

Things to test:
1. Load an entry
	1.1 Empty? Unoccupied?
	1.2 Correct EAddr? Correct value?
	1.3 What if addressing is completely wrong?
	1.4 What if address exceeds page table capacity?
2. Store
	2.1 Empty? Unoccupied?
	2.2 Correct EAddr? Correct value?
	2.3 What happens when trying to overwrite?
	2.4 What is address or value is completely wrong?
	2.5 What if address exceeds page table capacity?
	2.6 What if value exceeds PTE capacity?
3. Is page table completely deleted / unallocated after execution? (May need the display function here)
