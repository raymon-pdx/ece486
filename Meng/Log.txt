Address passed in: 16 bit - int type
Erase first 4 bits (don't care) using mask
Then break down the rest 12 bits into page number + offset
in order to set up page table

Prompt to confirm delete or overwrite

bitset

1/28/15

Create wrapper functions for LOAD and STORE
prompt user to confirm things (all done in wrapper function):
i. Read from an address that is NULL
ii. Delete data at an address which is unoccupied
iii. Delete existing data
iv. Overwrite existing data

The occupied is not necessary; as long as there's a check to see if it is NULL.
Add "probe" public function to display an entry to see if it exists.
Add separate "breakdown" private function to break down address into pagenumber + offset
Constructor now takes in a whole address (up to 16 bits) and then use "breakdown" to get correct number of pages and capacity of page

1/30/15

Create probe function
breakdown function done
