DESC: Worklog for ECE 486 final project

[ISA Simulator]

My current task is to parse an input file
I have already started the project so right now
the worklog will lack in details.

[Test 1]
Created basic test to see if data is being parsed 
correctly for a correctly written input file.
file: test.txt

Result: everything works.

ALGORITHM: more specific parsing
  Create string to hold id1, id2, address1, address2
  Create numberCounter = 0
  Create addressCounter = 0
  Create lineCounter = 0
  WHILE(not end of file) 
    increment lineCounter  
	WHILE(not end of line)
	  IF(current character is a number)
	    IF(number character is an octal number)
		  IF(numberCounter < 2 AND addressCounter == 0)
		    add current character to id1
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE IF(numberCounter < 2 AND addressCounter == 1)
		    add current character to id2
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE IF(numberCounter >= 2 AND addressCounter == 0)
		    add current character to address1
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE IF(numberCounter >= 2 AND addressCounter == 1)
		    add current character to address2
			increment numberCounter
	    ELSE number not octal
		  notify line number of error
		  exit program
		ENDIF
		
		IF(number counter >= 5)
		  return error and line number since too many numbers
		  exit program 
		ENDIF
		
	  ELSE character is not a number
	    ignore the character 
	END WHILE
	
	IF(no numbers in line)
	  output line number of error
	  end the program
	ENDIF
	
	set numberCounter to 0
	IF(addressCounter is 0) THEN
	  set addressCounter to 1
	ELSE
	  set addressCounter to 0
	
	use ids and addresses to determine opcode, I, M, and offset
	for the current line since no errors were found
  END WHILE	
END ALGORITHM

There is a problem with this algorithm so it needs to be revised

ALGORITHM: more specific parsing
  Create string to hold id1, id2, address1, address2
  Create numberCounter = 0
  Create addressCounter = 0
  Create lineCounter = 1
  create addressComplete bool variable
  WHILE(not end of file) 
    since beginning of line and first address
	set addressCounter to 0
	set numberCounter to 0
	set addressComplete to FALSE
	WHILE(both addresses not obtained)
	  WHILE(not end of line)
	    IF(addressCounter == 0)
		  IF(numberCounter < 1)
		    add current number to ID1 if valid
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE IF(numberCounter >= 1)
		    add current number to address1 if valid
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE
		    must be some other character so do nothing
		  ENDIF
	    ENDIF
	    IF(addressCounter == 1)
		  IF(numberCounter < 1)
		    add current number to ID2 if valid
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE IF(numberCounter >= 1)
		    add current number to address2 if valid
			increment numberCounter
		  ELSE
		    must be some other character so do nothing
		  ENDIF
	    ENDIF
		IF(numberCounter > the maximum allowed numbers)
		    return an error and exit program
		ENDIF
	  ENDWHILE (end of line)
	 
	  IF(no characters found in line)
	    assume line was garbage ex. typo newline character
		do not change addressCounter
	    move to next line
	  ELSE(appropriate number of characters found)
	    IF(addressCounter == 0)
		  set addressCounter to 1
		  increment lineCounter
		ELSE
		  set addressCounter to 0
		  increment lineCounter
		  indicate address finished
		  combine addresses
		ENDIF
	  ENDIF
	  set numberCounter to 0
	ENDWHILE (both addresses obtained)
	  
	use ids and addresses to determine opcode, I, M, and offset
	for the current line since no errors were found
  END WHILE (end of file)
	
END ALGORITHM

[Test 2]
Need to test that file can handle extra spaces and tabs
in file.  using test2.txt I found that the new algorithm 
handles additional spaces but goes into an endless loop 
after the last line of the file is finished.

after making some changes to the code, it now works
with any number of tabs, spaces, newlines, and characters
inserted throughout the text file.  
current error = newline after last character causes 
                infinite loop.
				
ALL WORKING

input found in test2.txt
output found in output2
backing up this code as ~ISASimulator_old2
created test3.txt for next set of tests


[NEXT STEP AFTER STUFF WORKING]
[LOAD STUFF INTO MEMORY]
  int MEM_LOAD(int)
  void MEM_STORE(int addr, int data)
  
I will now rework the code into a library of functions so it 
can easily be merged with everyone else's code.

Program steps for my code:
1. Parse line
2. place parsed line in memory
3. read memory and parse information into parts
  
  Placed functions in parser.h and parser.cpp
  
DEPENDENCIES LIST FOR CURRENT FUNCTIONS
1) getAddress()
     isOctal()
     exitMessage()
     octalToInt() 
2) parseAddress()
     createBinaryString()
	 findOpcode()
	   genOpcodeString()
	 getOffset()
3) octalToBinary()
4) octalToInt()
5) intToOctal()
5) createBinaryString()
6) genOpcodeString()
7) findOpcode()
     genOpcodeString()
8) isOctal()	
9) getOffset() 


[2/16/2015]

created a new project called ECE486_PDP8
this project will contain are merged code we
all built separately.  Meng worked on memory, Omi
and Even worked in bits, and I worked on parser.

cleaned up main.cpp to only read a file and add its
  data to memory.
  
added ability to display additional debugging information
through the command line by passing 1 as argument 2.


[2/18/2015]

ALGORITHM: program execution
  Begin running program
  set PC to 200 octal
  WHILE (program running) DO
    fetch data at PC
    increment PC
	decode data
	execute data
    print statistics
  END WHILE
END ALGORITHM

I am now coding in the execution part of the code after
the the file is loaded.  This happens in main.cpp

NOTE: I just learned that the address given by 01 is 
      used to store the data initially.
      
ALGORITHM: load input into memory
  WHILE(not end of file)
    IF(id is 1) THEN
      is address so save address
	  set memoryOffset to 0
	  get next address
	  WHILE(still data)
	    IF (id is 0) THEN
	      store data to memory at ADDRESS + OFFSET
		  get next piece of data
		ENDIF
	  ENDWHILE
	ELSE
		return error since address must be before data
	ENDIF
  ENDWHILE
END ALGORITHM

[2/19/2015]

implemented the algorithm seen above in main.cpp
I am continuing to flesh out the program and even 
alter the BitTwiddle class.  I will continue working on
this while Even merges the older code together. 
Hopefully this results in two working programs.

[2/22/2015]

wrote out on a piece of paper how to parse data for 
micro and io instructions.  Added constants.h with
constants stored in a namespace called pdp8.  This
will make it easier to change constants values if need
be.  I also added new parser functions.  Each function
uses masks and bit shifting since Evan pointed out
how inefficient my previous parser function is.

[2/23/2015]

convert output in main.cpp to octal rather than decimal.

to compile code using assembler type:
~faustm\bin\pal -o add01.as

[2/24/2015]

decided to save the state of memory to a text file at 
the end of program execution.

ADDED DEGUB LEVELS: DESCRIPTION
level 0: standard program output
level 1: prints output for program flow
level 2: prints info specific too simulation operation (non-verbose)
level 3: function internals and verbose output
!SILENT: prints pretty yet informative information
         

[3/2/2015]

wrote down list of all instructions and checking off
which ones were tested.
