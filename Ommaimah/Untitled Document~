The "Final Project Report" is attached. 

It includes the format we can use and some categories we can work on filling in during the project implementation. 

NOTE: The format is weird if you open it in a Linux machine, but don't worry, I will fix the formatting and do final edits for the report when we are finishing up the project.

IMPORTANT:
- Please type your tests done as soon as you finish them. It will be harder to remember what was tested later on in the term.
