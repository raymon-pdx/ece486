Project Report:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Project Report "Draft 1" is attached. 

It includes the format we can use and some categories we can work on filling in during the project implementation. Feel free to add/write anything on it. Open to all suggestions.

NOTE: The format is weird if you open it in a Linux machine, but don't worry, I will fix the formatting and do final edits for the report when we are finishing up the project.

IMPORTANT:
- Please type your tests done as soon as you finish them. It will be harder to remember what was tested later on in the term.
- Please save all images you make, it will be helpful to add in the report when we discuss our understanding and implementations.
